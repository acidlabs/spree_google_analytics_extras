SpreeGoogleAnalyticsExtras
==========================

Introduction goes here.

Installation
------------

Add spree_google_analytics_extras to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_google_analytics_extras'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_google_analytics_extras:install
```

Usage
-----

Out of the box this extension will send information to Google Analytics for the following actions

* View the details of a product (spree/products#show)
* Add a product to the cart from the product's details view

If in your store you have the option to add products directly from a list of products or from any other page, the add to cart button must have the following attributes

```
<button class="add-to-cart-button" data-sku="PRODUCT_SKU" data-name="PRODUCT_NAME" data-price="PRODUCT_PRICE"></button>
```

It can be a `button` or an `a` tag or any element that has the `add-to-cart-button` css class and responds to the `click` event.


Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_google_analytics_extras/factories'
```
